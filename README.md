# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-On-Pokemon-Dataset


### DATASET:

The Pokemon dataset is a listing of all Pokemon species as of mid-2016, containing data about their type and statistics. Considering how diverse Pokemon are, I was interested in analyzing this datset to learn how the game is balanced and to potentially identify the best Pokemon, if there exists one.
